  Resource_TypeNotInferredFromMimetype "(Save for the future testing, reedit): When using custom typechecker configuration, a user might drag a file onto a session that has a mimetype that does not occur in the controlled vocabularies for WrittenResource? or MediaFile? formats. Then, Arbil does cannot determine which of these resource types to create and gives an (rather technical) error message and fails. This can be improved by telling the user it is probably trying to do something undesirable but can proceed by choosing either type (much like when overriding typechecker decision"
