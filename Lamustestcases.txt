# The lines should not be longer than about 150 characters, so the program can still display them on a screen with a width of only 1280 pixel
# testcases adapted to new testing Arbil on 30 November
# The generated XSD should be uploaded to:
#   lux09:/data/corpora/MPI_workspace/tg/test_plans/
# The version used by Arbil is then accessible under http://www.mpi.nl/world/data/3439243/
