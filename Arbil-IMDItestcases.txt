  AddResourceLocation "Right click on an archivable resource and select \"Insert Manual Resource Location\". Add the URI in the window that appears (look for the URI in the IMDI corpus; take the URL of one of the resources of the PeWi corpus)).

  TypecheckerConfiguration5 "Put the filetypes.txt file (get it from https://trac.mpi.nl/wiki/LATSoftwareTesting) in the Arbil working directory [NOTE: if you are testing on a Mac you may not be able to see this directory, in which case you will have to save the file first and then copy it in the directory via the terminal (cp LOCATION/FILENAME .arbil/)]. Open it with a text editor and delete the code part where it reads the jpg files (cut that part and paste it somewhere because you will need it later; try to remember at what point in the text that part was located); save and start Arbil."
  TypecheckerConfiguration6 "Copy the *second JPG* to the working directory. The JPG should appear as *not archivable*. "
  TypecheckerConfiguration6a "Drag this item into the local corpus. You shouldn't be allowed to do so."

  NewMimetype2 "Replace the word 'BADTYPE' with 'GOOD' (you must use capital letters). Save the file. NOTE: the file should already be in the .arbil directory. If not, save the file there. If you are testing on a Mac, see test no. 5 above. Restart Arbil."
  NewMimetype3 "Add a .doc file to a working directory in the Files tab below the local corpus (if you do not have any .doc files already saved on your computer go to https://trac.mpi.nl/wiki/LATSoftwareTesting#no1 and download the file called doc_sample.doc. The file should carry an icon with a sort of square and a tick in it, meaning that it is an archivable file, but Arbil does not know whether it is a media file or a written resource."
  NewMimetype4 "Drag the file to a session node in the local corpus. You should get a dialogue window asking you to choose whether the file is a media file or a written resource."
