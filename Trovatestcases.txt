MultipleLayerSearch
  SearchString1 "In any of the white strings enter one single word (leave the various constraints aside for the moment); click on 'Find'; the results will be shown as in the 'Substring Search' mode (the 'Action' drop down menu will also display ALL the options seen for the Substring and the Single Layer Searches)"

In the results you should see the annotation in both languages and the names of the tiers."
  SearchString6 "Do what you did in the previous test but in the end, instead of 'Fully aligned' choose, for e.g., 'begin time - begin time > X milliseconds'. A window will open asking you to enter the number of milliseconds, try just >500"
  SameParent "Choose the option 'Must have same parent' (right to the search strings fields) and in the white fields use the two words and the same tier types you used for 'SearchString5' test. Between them choose 'No constraints'. "
  ParentChild "Choose the option 'Must be parent and child'. In the top left white field enter, for e.g. \"25\" (the parent tier), whereas below it enter, for e.g. \"tomorrow\" (the child tier). Choose the corresponding tier types and 'No constraints' from the green menu between the two white fields."
  SameFile "Use the same search strings of the previous test but choose 'Must be in same file' and 'All Tiers'. Trova will search for two tiers belonging to the same annotation file but without a specified relationship between them."
  MultpleConstraints "Try to select two tier constraints from the menu (e.g. Must be in the same file, and Must have same parent), by holding the Ctrl button on the keyboard.  Check the info balloon to see if Trova got the right annotaions."
  Wildcard "Enter a word in the first and third top search string fields, and in the middle enter \".+\". From the list in the green menu choose '= N annotations', when a window pops up type 0 . Select 'regular expression' and 'Find': you should see three annotations, the 1st and the 3rd containing the 1st and 3rd word of the searched string, the 2nd including all the possibilities found"
  Negation "Do as in the previous test but instead of \".+\" enter \"NOT(...)\", and in brackets write a word you don't want to be searched for.

  ActionSaveHits "Select one of the results and 'Save Hits'; a dialogue window will open asking you to select the export format  and the fields to exports. Click on 'Export' and save"
  SortTierLists "Try the two options next to 'Sort tier lists'. In the first case you should get the tiers arranged alphabetically. In the second case, they should appear according to the number of matches in a decreasing order ."
  ModeCaseInsensitive "Enter a proper name with a small letter: the search engine will show you the results all the same"
  ModeCaseSensitive "Enter a proper name with a small letter: Trova won't find any results, or however fewer than with the previous constraint"
  ModeSubstringMatch "Enter a string and select 'substring match': the string will be only a part of the annotation found"
  ModeExactMatch "Enter a string (see annotation in Annex) and select 'exact match': the string will coincide with the annotation found"
  ModeRegularExpression "In the top and middle left white search strings enter, respectively, regular expressions of this type: \"^[fm][ao]ther\" and \"^[pm][aãie]\". From the green string menu between them choose the option 'Fully aligned'. Then select 'regular expression' mode and 'Find'. In the results you should see two tiers with the annotations in English and Portuguese where the words \"mother\" and \"father\" appear in both languages"
  ModeRegularExpression2 "Follow the same steps as in the previous test but instead of 'Fully aligned' choose, for e.g., 'begin time - begin time > X milliseconds'. A window will open asking you to enter the number of milliseconds, try >500"
  ModeVariableMatch "Enter an 'x' (the variable) in one of the top and middle white strings, and use the constraint 'Overlap' between them.  In the results you should see pairs of annotations containing the same text (double check this function by looking at the annotations in Annex)."
  ModeResetForm "After entering some search strings select 'Reset form': the strings will be cancelled"
  ModeUnicodeInput1 "Change the keyboard language to, for e.g., Portuguese. Then try to type in one of the white strings a Portuguese word with special characters, for e.g. \"mãe\". "
  ModeUnicodeInput2 "Select one of the white strings and the mode 'Unicode Input'. An orange window should open with a white string. If you type there the word with special characters this should appear directly into the white string selected"
  TimeMinimalDuration "Look at the file transcritpion in Annex and choose a value for the minimal duration of the annotation; when selecting 'Minimal Duration' a window should open asking you to enter the value in milliseconds or in the mode hours/minute/sseconds/milliseconds. "
  TimeMaximalDuration "Do the same as for 'Minimal Duration' and then enter a search string"
  TimeBeginAfter "Like you did for 'Minimal' and 'Maximal Duration', look at the file transcription in Annex and choose a time after which you want your annotation search to begin"
  TimeEndBefore "Do the same as for 'Begin After'; the only difference being that in this case you choose a time before which you want your annotation search to finish"

  Font "Try to change the type of character and the size of the results shown to check if it works"
  History "If you click on the 'History' drop down menu you can see the previous queries you made "
  ShowTimeAlignment1 "Write something in the top and middle left white search strings (like, for ex. 'father' and 'pai'). Choose the constraint you want. 'Find'. Next to the 'Font' menu there should appear the voice 'Show time alignment'."
  ShowTimeAlignment2 "Check the voice 'Show time alignment'. Above each of the results you should see begin and end time of the annotations, their duration in milliseconds, and two blue bars."
  Scale1 "Once you check 'Show time alignment', the menu 'Scale' should appear next to it, and the default option should be 'Stretch to fit', which means each result shows its own duration and timing, and the two bars stretch as much as they can."
  Scale2 "Change the 'Scale' menu from 'Stretch to fit' to another value (like, for ex. 10 sec). Now all the results should report the duration of 10 seconds, and the bars too should adjust to the scale chosen."
  InfoViewOptions1 "Click on 'Info View Options' on the left of the 'Font' menu. A window should open asking you to choose what to show and to hide.  Uncheck the first two of the lists and see if changes apply."
  InfoViewOptions2 "Uncheck all the information which would go into the balloon. If you place the mouse cursor over the results, no balloon should appear. "
  InfoViewOptions3 "Uncheck all the information that would go into the column on the right of the results. No column should appear. "
