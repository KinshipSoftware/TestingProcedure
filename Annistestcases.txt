SearchFormAnnotation
  SearchFormCorpora1 "Check one corpus (e.g., degadn22_Paula) and enter a search string between double quotation marks in the AnnisQL window (e.g.: \"moraal\"). Note that the search is case sensitive, so it will not find cases of capitalized 'Moraal'."
  SearchFormCorpora2 "Click on the first item which appears under 'Node annotations'. In the window 'Search Form' you should see the AnnisQL and the result of the annotation selected. "
  SearchFormCorpora3 "Under 'Available annotation' click on 'Name', then in column and uncheck 'Example' and 'Url'. Now it is only possible to see the name of the item. Repeat this step for 'Example' and for 'Url'. "

  ShowResults6 "Under the blue bar, click on the icon indicating name of the annotation plus 'grid'.  You should get a table in which the annotation is fragemnted in single chunk and different annotation levels. "
  ShowResults7 "Under the table you should be able to move from left to right of the annotation by an additional blue bar diplayed under the table."
  ShowResults8 "Click on 'Select displayed annotation levels'. Uncheck 'Seg_ModS1'. It should then disappear from the table. Do the same for Seg_ModS2'. Only the annotations tokens should be displayed in the table."

  QueryBuilderAnnotationSearch2 "On the left-hand side of the toolbar at the top of the query builder canvans, you will see the Create Node button. Use this button to define nodes to be searched for (tokens, non-terminal nodes or annotations)."
  QueryBuilderAnnotationSearch3 "In each node you create you may click on \"Add\" to specify an annotation value. The annotation name can be typed in or selected from a drop down list."
  QueryBuilderAnnotationSearch4 "Creating nodes and modifying them on the canvas will immediately update the AnnisQL field in the Search Form with your query, though updating the query on the Search Form will not create a new graph in the Query Builder."
  QueryBuilderAnnotationSearch5 "The \"Op[erator]\" field in the middle allows you to choose between an exact match (the '=' symbol) or wildcard search using Regular Expressions (the '~' symbol). The annotation value is given on the right, and should NOT be surrounded by quotations"
  QueryBuilderAnnotationSearch6 "It is also possible to specify multiple annotations applying to the same position by clicking on \"Add\" multiple times. Clicking on \"Clear\" will delete the values in the node."
  QueryBuilderAnnotationSearch7 "To search for word forms, simply leave the field name on the left empty and type directly on the right under \"Value\". A node with no data entered will match any node, that is an underspecified token or non-terminal node or annotation."
  QueryBuilderAnnotationSearchEdge "Repeat step two of this items test group. Press once again on the 'Create Corpora button'. Now two windows should be displayed. "
  QueryBuilderAnnotationSearchEdge2 "To specify the relationship between nodes, first click on the \"Edge\" button at the top left of one node, and then click the \"Dock\" button which becomes available on the other nodes."

ExportAnnotation
  ExportAnnotationWindow "Repeat ShowResults step. Click on 'Export' at the left bottom of the page. By going to the Export tab at the bottom of the search form on the left, you can select one of four exporters: the SimpleTextExporter, the TextExporter, the WekaExporter and the GridExporter."
  ExportAnnotationSimpleTextPerformer "The The SimpleTextExporter simply gives the text for all tokens in each search result, including context, in a one-row-per-hit format. The tokens covered by the match area are marked with square brackets and the results are numbered."
  ExportAnnotationTextExporter "Repeat the export procedure but change from 'SimpleTextExporter' to 'TextExporter'. A web page should be opened with the annotations sources. The TextExporter adds all annotations of each token separated by slashes (e.g. dogs/NN/dog for the token dogs annotated with a part-of-speech NN and a lemma dog). Check if it possible to select part of the text and past it in a text file."
  ExportAnnotationWekaExporter "Repeat the export procedure but change from 'TextExporter' to 'WekaExporter'. A web page should be opened with the annotations sources. The WekaExporter outputs the format used by the WEKA machine learning tool. Check if it possible to select part of the text and past it in a text file."
  ExportAnnotationGridExporter "Repeat the export procedure but change from 'WekaExporter' to 'GridExporter'. A web page should be opened with the annotations sources. The GridExporter adds all annotations available for the span of retrieved tokens, with each annotation layer in a separate line. Check if it possible to select part of the text and past it in a text file."
